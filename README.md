# Restaurant Management
 The use of computer simulation to assess and enhance the service of a Restaurant. Currently, they have ‘M’ cooks and they want to determine the service criteria -- that is, the criteria based on which an order should be serviced (i.e. prepared) earlier or later than others, to maximize average customer satisfaction. Because the TAs are currently busy running their new business, they ask you to help them, using your programming skills and knowledge of data structures, to write a simulation program that simulates the Restaurant kitchen system and calculates some statistics that measure average customer satisfaction
